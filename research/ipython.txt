add this line anywhere at startup: import pystuck; pystuck.run_server().

this script is the client, once invoked it connects to the debuggee
and prints the debugee's threads stack traces (good for most cases).
in addition, it opens an ipython prompt with an rpyc connection that provides
access to the debuggee's modules (good for inspecting variables).
