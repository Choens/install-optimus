Currently, enipy supports Earth Networks lightning data, including reading and writing detection reports, opening real-time data feeds, reading and correlating raw waveform data, and visualizing the data.  The tools fully support, and have been used for, the analysis of very large data sets of 600 million lightning flashes or more.  Enipy is under continuous development by the Earth Networks R&D team, with features being added regularly.  The eventual goal is for these tools to support all Earth Networks data products.  As the tools should be generally useful to the community at large, they have been open-sourced under a very permissive the MIT license.
